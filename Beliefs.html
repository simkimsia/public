<h1>My beliefs</h1>

<p>Review every quarter (<a href="README.md">README</a>).</p>

<h2>On the purpose of life</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is probably no purpose and meaning in life.</li>
<li>That does not mean I cannot make one up myself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On navigating through my life as a journey</h2>

<ul>
<li>Thinking in themes makes it easier to have a set of consistent values.</li>
<li>Having a set of consistent values makes it easier to make important decisions.</li>
<li>Having an easier time making important decisions improves quality of life.</li>
<li>Being flexible and avoiding useless dogma is important. Being principled and avoiding unconvincing flip-flopping is also important.</li>
<li>These two values together represent a dilemma when living my life.</li>
<li>So far, my only answer to this dilemma is to :

<ul>
<li>choose my themes very carefully,</li>
<li>embrace these themes as mine completely,</li>
<li>stick to my themes religiously,</li>
<li>allow extreme flexibility in my choice of tactics and strategies to accomplish my themes,</li>
<li>while allowing minimal flexibility in my choice of themes after I have chosen them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Themes</h2>

<ul>
<li>I adopt two themes to live by: Be generous. Be consistent.</li>
<li>My opinion and choices in all or most issues like morality, interpersonal relationships, and even business-related stuff will be determined by these two themes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On making sense of the world around us</h2>

<ul>
<li>Frankly, I have no idea and no certainty what is true for sure and what is false for sure.</li>
<li>At this stage, I trust the scientists with regards to physical phenomena while not dismissing the mystics and the philosophers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On Usefulness vs Accuracy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Usefulness is more important than accuracy.</li>
<li>I can use the wrong working or model, but still arrive at the correct or useful answer. In my life, having the correct or useful answer is usually more important.</li>
<li>Knowing exactly why something works is usually less important than knowing what works.</li>
<li>Facts, strategies, tactics, problems, and solutions do not exist in a vaccuum. They exist within a context, a narrative, or a perspective.</li>
<li>From this point onwards, the word <code>perspective</code> is used interchangeably with <code>context</code> and <code>narrative</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On Truth</h2>

<ul>
<li>The most important <code>truths</code> are often deep and powerful. They are applicable in many areas and across multiple contexts.</li>
<li>For these truths to be applicable in so many areas and contexts, they need to be fluid.</li>
<li>By its nature, language will always fix and define concepts.</li>
<li>We communicate with one another using language. </li>
<li>This means that the most important and fluid <code>truths</code> likely cannot be taught, or explained. Hence the term <code>ineffable</code>. These important <code>truths</code> can only be shown or experienced. They cannot be explained fully. They can be hinted at, or explained indirectly.</li>
<li>There is a non-zero chance that some <code>truths</code> cannot even be known at all.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On Judgement</h2>

<ul>
<li>Everything is important. Some things are <strong>more</strong> important than others.</li>
<li>A good perspective is worth 80 IQ points.</li>
<li>Choosing a useful perspective often opens up strategies and solutions not previously thought of before. </li>
<li>Choosing a useful perspective can also have the effect of rendering a problem into nothing, or turning a disadvantage into a benefit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meta</h2>

<ul>
<li>We have some control over what we believe in, but not as much as we tend to think we have.</li>
<li>Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong, and that&#39;s okay.</li>
<li>I&#39;m willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong.</li>
<li>Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)</li>
</ul>
