My Manifesto
========================================================

These are the Rules I have chosen to live by.
Review every quarter, and every year on my birthday ([README](README.md)).

1. I will be my word.
2. I will accept myself, and the consequences of being myself as the price for serenity and being at peace. 
3. I will accept this is a good and fair price to pay for the serenity and peace of mind.
